# BCOG-PERSONAL
 Just some snippets from some of the work I conducted in BRAIN AND COGNITIVE SCIENCE 200: PROGRAMMING FOR THE BRAIN AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES.
The "analyze books" file is the one I wrote from scratch, with high-level instructions. The books were handpicked by me. This project involved text analysis in Python. The other Python files were solutions I wrote to the lab problems.
