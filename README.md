# BCOG-PERSONAL
 Just some of the work I conducted in the final lab for BRAIN AND COGNITIVE SCIENCE 200: PROGRAMMING FOR THE BRAIN AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES.
 
The "analyze books.py" file is the one I wrote from scratch, with high-level instructions. The books were handpicked by me. This project involved text analysis in Python. The other Python files were solutions I wrote to the lab problems. Please enter the folder and find the relevant files.
